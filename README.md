This is my private React project - fetching data from GoogleBooks API by title/author.. and displaying them as a list. ( webpack,es6,sass)

## What will be added in future

currently there is small bug which you need to first add task lists later edit them, trying edit existed list and later adding new will not add them "edit list function". First i will like to repeir that later add local storage and then try to add better UI

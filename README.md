This is my private React project - fetching data from GoogleBooks API by title/author.. and displaying them as a list. ( webpack,es6,sass)

## What will be added in future

// currently there is small bug which you need to first add task lists later edit them, trying edit existed list and later adding new will not add them "edit list function". // - fixed *
Add some style
Add local storage
